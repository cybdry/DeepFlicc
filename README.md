# DeepFlicc
DeepFlicc is the name of my  Bsc. graduation project.The idea is applied DeepLearning Algorithm on Distributed
Computer vision Systems.
# To Do
 - [x] Fix JPEG data corruption bug with custom ***peg_healthy_check(jpeg_buffer_size)*** function
   [Bug to fix](bug1.png)
 - [ ] Connected more than one remote device
 - [ ] Finished the Qt interface to display more than one remote display simultanously
 
 # How to use the code ðŸ”¥
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
 :fire: Warning :fire: This Project was `developed and tested on Linux based operating sistem`,I dont know if everything could gone well on Microsoft 
 Window Operating Systems.
 - ***Client Side source Code<br/>***
=======
## ***Client Side source Code<br/>***
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
> first of all prepare you raspberry pi 3B+ or superior with pi camera runing raspbian operating system.<br/>
Use [this tutorial](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-use-putty-ssh) to learn how to connect to your raspberry pi throught using putty ***if your host system is based on window operating system***. ***If your host system was  based in linux***, use [This tutorial](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-linux-install-openssh-server/).<br/>
- *Step 1*: Make sure you have pip3 install in you system.You can check it by runing the command below:<br/>
```
which pip3
or 
pip3 --version
```
if pip3 hasn't been installed you can installed by doing:
```
 sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
After pip have been installed ,you can now install `python-opencv` and other dependencies by runing :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
inside `client folder`</br>
Since we are using `User Datagram Protocol (UDP)` you can start the client by runing:
```
python client.py <server-ip-address>
```
Dont forget to replace `<server-ip-address>` by the ip adress of your host computer.
If your host computer's OS is Linux based operating system, you can get the ip with these commands:`hostname -I `,`ifconfig` </br>
if the Os is based on microsoft windows you can  run `ipconfig` by specifing other parameter of course.
- ***Server Side Code</br>***
First of all,go into the server folder and then the folder named `data/videos` and create some subfolder.
The name of each subfolder must represent the name  of the persone you want your Model to identify.
You have to take one or two short video like `10 secondes` each who capture every aspect of the face 
of the persone you want identify and make sure that it's this persone onlly who appear in the video to 
confuse the Network when training.
After that go back to `server` folder and  run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
if `pip` was not installed followed the same step explained on client side code to install `pip`.
If all was gone well ,it's time to start the training by runing:
```
python precompute.py
```
It may take some time to train the `Model`. A PC with a `GPU` enable can help a lot in the case you can many `classes`. 
=======
- *Step 2*: Install the required library
move into `client` folder to run on command line `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install dependancies
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

After the training it's time to see the result of the whole system.
Start the server side code and make sure it's starting sending the data.After that start the server side code
by runing  `python live_face_recon.py` . If everything is going well after some secondes you will see a video frame windows pop-up on your
host computer and showing the remote client camera image frame in a real-time. It will recongnize the face the of persone who their image was used
to train the Model with certain likehood if not it will write `unknown`.
